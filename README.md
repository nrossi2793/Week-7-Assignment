# Week 7 Assignment
Well, I'd still like to keep this as simple as I can for the sake of not being overwhelmed and creating something decent for the final project.  

Based off that, I was thinking about just an online piano player? So you would load up the page, and have the option to click a variety of virtual piano keys to generate a tone. I would need a series of functions kind of like we did in a previous example for play, wait, sustain etc. and I would need to be able to access the data for each note from a certain library. I'd love to hear some feedback and things others may be thinking for this idea. I just want to do something musically related.
